# Festival JSON Converter
Converts the festival's JSON song list into a metadata format for other music games

## ⚠️ THE FESTIVAL JSON FILES WILL NOT BE AVAILABLE FOR DOWNLOAD ⚠️
If you happen to have the files, this will help convert it partially.
This converts only the metadata and downloads the album art and song data.
The music must be downloaded & streamed separately, and the MIDI data must be converted.

This only allows for conversion of the metadata.
